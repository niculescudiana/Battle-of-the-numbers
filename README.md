# Battle-of-the-numbers
Card game

Battle of the numbers is a bluffing and deduction game for two players that contains only sixteen cards, with each player trying to figure out the best time to end the round so that they can win. The goal each round is to have a hand of cards with a higher sum than the opponent, but equal to or less than the sum played to the table.

To set up a round, deal six cards face down to each player, then remove the remaining four cards, unseen, from the game. On your turn, you take one of these five actions:

1: PLAY a card from your hand to the table, overlapping any cards previously played and announcing the sum of all revealed cards. (Click on the card you want to play, then click on the upper left part of the screen).

2: DRAW the most recently played card from the table and place it in front of you; this card counts as being in your hand, thereby increasing the sum of your hand and lowering the sum on the table, but you cannot discard or play this card. (Click on the card you want to draw, it will be automatically placed in your hand).

3: DISCARD a card from your hand, placing it to the side out of play for this round. (Click on the card you want to discard, then click on the upper right part of the screen).

---For the first mode of play:
4: KNOCK to end the round and see who wins; you may do this only if the sum of cards in your hand is equal to or less than the sum on the table. The players then compare sums, and whoever has the highest sum (without going over the sum of cards on the table) wins; if the players are tied, the player who knocked loses. (Click on the END GAME button).

---For the second mode of play:
4: KNOCK to end the round and see who wins; you may do this only if the sum of cards in your hand is equal to or higher than the sum on the table. The players then compare sums, and whoever has the lowest sum (without going under the sum of cards on the table) wins; if the players are tied, the player who knocked loses. (Click on the END GAME button).
